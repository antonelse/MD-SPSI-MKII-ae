# MD-SPSI-MKII-ae
A bunch of drum/synth kits that I made for the _Elektron MachineDrum SPSI MKII_.

### How To
For this task you have to connect your machine to your PC through a MIDI cable. 
In order to load the [sysex](http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midispec/sysex.htm) file into your machine, you can use the official [C6 SysEx Manager](https://www.elektron.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Elektron_C6_MAC_AND_WIN_1.51.zip). **But**, keep in mind that from _macOS 10.15 Catalina_, Apple will not support 32-bit software, so it will no longer be possible to use C6 with your Elektron devices. \
To overcome this problem, an alternative solution could be [SysEx Librarian](https://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/). 
More info [here](https://www.elektronauts.com/news/486).


If you are not familiar with sysex transfer, you can refere to the [official manual](https://www.elektron.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/machinedrum_manual_OS1.63.pdf) under the section `GLOBAL SETTINGS/FILE/SYSEX RECEIVE` (page 66). \
**NB.** If you want to place this kit after your personal kit, please refere to the section `./SPECIFIC PLACE SYSEX RECEIVE` (page 68)
